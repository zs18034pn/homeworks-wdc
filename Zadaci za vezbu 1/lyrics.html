        [Verse 1]
        They say, "Oh my God, I see the way you shine
        Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine"
        You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

        [Pre-Chorus]
        Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
        And oh my, I, I like your style
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

        [Chorus]
        So they say
        Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh

        And when you’re done, I'll make you do it all again

        [Verse 2]
        I said, "Oh my God, I see you walking by
        Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes"
        Just like a monkey, I've been dancin’ my whole life
        But you just beg to see me dance just one more time

        [Pre-Chorus]
        Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
        And oh my, I, I like your style
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

        [Chorus: Drake]
        Workin' on a weekend like usual
        Way off in the deep end like usual
        Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
        Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
        Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
        Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
        Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
        Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush
        
        [Verse: Drake]
        Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
        Know you see my texts, baby, please say some
        Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
        Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
        Bitch, this is fame, not clout
        I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
        Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
        I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
        Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
        Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
        Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
        Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit
        
        [Chorus: Drake]
        Workin' on a weekend like usual
        Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
        Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
        Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
        Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts

        Oh,  oh, oh
        Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

        [Verse 1]
        We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
        I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
        I  couldn't be there even when I tried
        You  don't believe it, we do this every time

        [Chorus]
        Seasons change and our love went cold
        Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away
        I dare you to do something
        I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away, run away

        [Verse 2]
        Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
        I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
        You thought that it was special, special
        But it was just the sex though, the sex though
        And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
        I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

        [Chorus]
        Seasons change and our love went cold
        Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away
        I dare you to do something
        I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away, run away

        [Bridge]
        Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
        It's only me, what you got to lose?
        Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
        It's only me, let it go

        [Chorus]
        Seasons change and our love went cold
        Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away
        I dare you to do something

        [Verse 1]
        I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
        This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
        I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
        Somebody to have, somebody to hold
        It's easy to say, but it's never the same
        I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

        [Chorus]
        Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
        And you're not here to get me through it all
        I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

        [Verse 2]
        I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
        This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
        Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
        Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
        It's easy to say, but it's never the same
        I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

        [Chorus]
        Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
        And you're not here to get me through it all
        I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

        [Bridge]
        And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
        I fall into your arms
        I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

        [Chorus]
        For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
        And you're not here to get me through it all
        I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
        But now the day bleeds into nightfall
        And you're not here to get me through it all
        I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
        I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
